Question 1:

I take a sentence and pass it onto my function that segments it

The approach is that:

I keep a track of index where I am standing in a sentence 
I keep matching that with every word in the dictionary 
If ( no match )
    I append the char and move index +=1 
If ( there are matches)
    I get the max out of them in a temp List 
    move index += len ( maxMatch)
I keep on doing this for every sentence then I eventually
write them up in a file

Question 2:

The corpus is a test corpus that I borrowed from my friend containing
23k+ words
